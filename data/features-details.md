# üéóÔ∏è Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset Columns Details


We're working with the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset** ‚Äî a classic dataset used in cancer prediction. Each feature describes characteristics of **cell nuclei** present in an image of a breast mass (tumor), and they help in distinguishing **benign (non-cancerous)** from **malignant (cancerous)** tumors.

Here is a **detailed table** explaining each column, its meaning, and its role in cancer detection:

### ‚úÖ Summary
- **Mean** columns capture average measurements.
- **SE** (Standard Error) columns measure **variation** ‚Äî how consistent or inconsistent the cell shapes are.
- **Worst** columns show **extreme values** ‚Äî helpful for identifying the most severe cases.

üëâ **Malignant tumors** tend to:
- Be larger (radius, area, perimeter)
- Have rougher, more irregular shapes
- Be less symmetrical
- Have more concave points and higher compactness
